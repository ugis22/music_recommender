# Music recommender system

A **recommender** (or recommendation) **system** (or engine) is a filtering system which aim is to predict a rating or preference a user would give to an item, eg. a film, a product, a song, etc.
  
There are two main types of recommender systems:

- Content-based filters
- Collaborative filters

However, nowadays a combination of both approaches is used.

> *Content-based methods* gives recommendations based on the similarity of two song contents or attributes while 
> *collaborative methods* make a prediction on posible preferences using a matrix with ratings on different songs.

**Content-based methods** are computationally fast and interpretable. Moreover, they can be efficiently adapted to new items or users. 
However, one of the biggest limitations of content-based recommendation systems is that the model only learns to recommend items of the same type that the user is already using or, in our case, listening to. Even though this could be helpful, the value of that recommendation is significantly less because it lacks the surprise component of discovering something completely new.

**Collaborative-based methods**
